*First commit*

Scenario:

I open the app and I see my to-do list pulled from gradescope, canvas, and my personal additions. I click a tab on the left and a calendar view appears of the tasks I have on my list. A notifications bar on the right shows me changes I haven't seen. The app sends me notifications on discord whenever a quiz, assignment or announcement is posted, when something is graded, or when something is successfully submitted. If I submit an assignment or quiz, it should be crossed out and greyed out on the to-do list and calendar.
